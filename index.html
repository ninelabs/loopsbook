          <p>Loops is a great resource for anyone developing a digital product, app, or even website. It's like a more people-focused version of The Lean Startup. Cornelius gives a well-rounded look at product development, more than just "create an MVP and repeat." Sure, he goes into brainstorming, creating a prototype, and testing, but he also covers the human element and branding & positioning. Overall, this is a great book that will really get you thinking about the usability and design of your product.</p>
